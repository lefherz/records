# cyberpunk
I would like to experiment with a new genre called cyberpunk. Currently cyberpunk is mainly a literature, movie, fashion and videogame genre, but the music community is also growing. I like to contribute to it by enhancing dark electro with dissonant, distorted guitar sounds and a distorted voice singing about cyberpunk topics, e.g. how computers feel, what the concept of body means to cyborgs, immortality.
I can sing, compose, write lyrics and play guitar, but for this project I need someone who is experienced with remixing. If you are interested, listen to $algorithmus.mp3 and write me an email =)
